---DEBUGGING INO-----

Using conditional compiling to test code without breaking the PROGRAMMING{
	solution the problem of slowly implementing new features and still having a working program
	in the start of the ino/c/cpp file write
			#define DEBUG_ON   1          //Conditional compilation for DEBUGGING
	now sprinkle the following around your new code
		#if  ( DEBUG_ON==1)
			//your code
		#endif
	you can then revert back to working version changing number afrer 'DEBUG_ON'
}
